## Global Constraints

* UI: match homepage look & feel (type scale, spacing, card shapes, buttons, colors).
* UX: simple, linear flows with clear progress and success states.
* Routes referenced below are final.
* After any successful onboarding submit, show a success state with a secondary CTA: “Explore public campaigns” → redirect to `/coming-soon`.

**Next**

## Step 2 — Investment Preferences

*This helps personalize your experience and match you with the most relevant AI startups operating in or expanding to the UAE. Our marketplace focuses exclusively on early-stage AI ventures (pre-seed and seed).*

1. **Investment Stage** (checkboxes; multi-select allowed)

   * **Pre-Seed** — Early-stage startups validating their idea or building their first MVP.
   * **Seed** — Startups with a working MVP, early traction, or first paying users.
     *(Hebed AI currently lists AI startups at early-stage maturity with verified ROI potential.)*

2. **AI Sector Focus** (checkboxes; multi-select)

   * AI SaaS
   * Fintech and Data Intelligence
   * PropTech and Real Estate AI
   * HealthTech
   * EdTech
   * AI Infrastructure and Tools
   * Other emerging AI applications *(show text input when selected)*

3. **Geographic Focus** (checkboxes; multi-select)

   * UAE *(default pre-checked)*
   * AI startups expanding into the UAE market
     *(We prioritize startups headquartered in or entering the UAE ecosystem.)*

4. **ROI Priorities** (checkboxes; multi-select)

   * Financial ROI (revenue, profitability)
   * Operational ROI (efficiency, scalability)
   * Innovation ROI (technology defensibility, product maturity)
   * Social or Sustainability ROI (impact-driven initiatives)
     *(Aligned with Hebed AI’s multidimensional ROI framework.)*

**Next**

## Step 3 — Visibility & Notices

1. **Profile Visibility** (radio)

   * Visible to verified AI startups *(recommended)*
   * Visible only after you show interest

2. **Accreditation (optional)** (checkbox)

   * I’m an accredited investor
     *If selected, our team may contact you later for access to larger or regulated investment rounds once our partnerships are active.*

3. **Investment Structure & Risk Notice** (non-interactive info)

   * Hebed AI facilitates matching; we don’t hold or manage investor funds.
   * Early-stage investments are high-risk and returns are not guaranteed.
   * We focus on verified ROI metrics, transparency, and UAE regulatory alignment.

**Submit**

**Submission:** show confirmation and CTA to `/coming-soon` (public campaigns preview).

---

# 3) `/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` — Profile Page Updates

* **Startup profile setup:** remove any **KYC** content/widget.
* **Investor view:** remove **Accreditation widget** from profile page (it remains in onboarding Step 3 as optional disclosure).

Acceptance:

* No KYC card or prompts render for startups.
* No Accreditation card renders for investors on this page.

---

# 4) Portfolio Button

* Any “Portfolio” button/link must redirect to **`/coming-soon`**.

---

# 5) `/discover` updates

* Remove **“funding goal”** field entirely.
* Replace page hero text:

  * From: “discover investment oppourtunities” *(typo)*
  * To: **“Explore verified AI matching opportunities”**
* In widgets: replace a displayed value **0 → n/A** for all widgets **except** the **first widget from the left (“Active Campaign”)** which may still show **0**.

Display logic:

```ts
const formatMetric = (value, {allowZero=false}) => {
  if (value === 0 && !allowZero) return 'n/A';
  return String(value);
}
// use formatMetric(metric, { allowZero: widget.key === 'activeCampaign' })
```

---

# 6) `investor-dashboard.tsx`

* Add **social widgets** to startup project detail panels/cards that investors follow or have marked as “interested in.”

  * **Comments** (count + latest 1–2, link to full thread)
  * **Followers** (count; avatar group of last 5)
* Placement: right rail on desktop; collapsible section below details on mobile.
* Empty states:

  * Comments: “No comments yet.”
  * Followers: “No followers yet.”

---

  description: string;
  geo: 'Based in the UAE' | 'Expanding into the UAE';
  dataMigrationMethod: 'plugin' | 'manual';
};

// Investor onboarding
type InvestorOnboarding = {
  investorType: 'Individual Investor'|'Angel Investor'|'VC Partner'|'Family Office';
  investmentTypes: Array<'Equity'|'Convertible Note / SAFE'|'Crowdfunding participation (via pooled round)'|'Strategic / Advisory'>;
  ticketRange: '≤$50k'|'$50k–$250k'|'$250k–$1M'|'$1M+';
  stages: Array<'Pre-Seed'|'Seed'>;
  sectors: string[]; // normalized list; include free-text if "Other"

  roiPriorities: Array<'Financial'|'Operational'|'Innovation'|'Social/Sustainability'>;
  visibility: 'visible'|'after_interest';
  accredited?: boolean;
};
```

# Copy Blocks (for reuse)

* **CTA:** In the meantime, you can explore the public campaigns.
  **Button:** Explore campaigns → `/coming-soon`
* **Manual CSV line:** “Click to download the template.csv” → **[hebed_ai_manual_metrics_template.csv](sandbox:/mnt/data/hebed_ai_manual_metrics_template.csv)**

---

# Accessibility & i18n

* All interactive controls labeled (`aria-label`), group legends for checkbox/radio groups.
* Keyboard focus visible; error summaries announced.
* Text ready for translation; avoid hard-coded currency symbols in logic (display only).

---

# QA / Acceptance Criteria

## `/onboarding/startup`

* Required fields block submission; inline errors displayed.
* Choosing **Plugin** shows plugin requirements list on success.
* Choosing **Manual** shows CSV prompt with working download link and same metrics list.
* Success view includes CTA to `/coming-soon`.

## `/onboarding/investor`

* Stepper shows 3 steps; cannot advance with missing required fields.
* “Other emerging AI applications” reveals a required free-text input only when checked.
* “UAE” is pre-checked in Geographic Focus.
* Submit shows confirmation + CTA to `/coming-soon`.

## `/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`

* Startup KYC widget not rendered.
* Investor Accreditation widget not rendered.

## `/discover`

* Funding goal field absent.
* Hero text updated to “Explore verified AI matching opportunities”.
* All widgets display `n/A` when value is 0 **except** “Active Campaign” (left-most), which may show **0**.

## `investor-dashboard.tsx`

* Social widgets render with counts; handle empty states gracefully.
* Avatars not shown when 0 followers; comment preview opens full thread.

---

# Engineering Notes

* **Routes:** guard with auth; save drafts on blur (optional).
* **Enums:** strictly typed; map to display labels centrally.
* **ARR:** for manual CSV, users may compute; in-app or during ingestion you may recompute `ARR = 12 * MRR_now`.
* **Redirections:** use a central `ROUTES.comingSoon = '/coming-soon'` constant.
* **Telemetry:** log onboarding completion `{ role: 'startup'|'investor', method: 'plugin'|'manual' }`.
